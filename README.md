My passion is to work as a hardware engineer, i love my work and will go above and beyond to achieve it.
My other hobbies(past-times) include Learning Python(and other programming related concepts),Gym, Playing piano, Spending time with Mom and Dad.
I also like to go driving on the weekends.

This gives me the satisfaction.
